  I received my Master’s degree from <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Zhejiang University</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/msong/669142.html" target="_blank">Prof. Mingli Song</a>. I specialized in image representation learning, computer vision, and multimodal large models, with a focus on unifying visual and semantic understanding across heterogeneous data. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Energy and Power Engineering from <a href="https://www.ustb.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology Beijing</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I am interning at <a href="https://bytedance.com/" target="_blank">ByteDance</a>, working on large - scale advertising algorithms to optimize user engagement through machine learning - driven solutions. My research centers on advancing multimodal representation learning (spanning video, image, and text) to enable AI systems to model user preferences with unprecedented precision. The long - term objective of my work is to pioneer universal cross - modal representations that transform advertising systems by enhancing AI’s ability to interpret complex user behaviors and preferences.
  </p>
  <p>
    My primary research areas include: <br>
    (1) <b>Multimodal Representation Learning</b>; <br>
    (2) <b>Large - Scale Recommendation Systems</b>; <br>
    (3) <b>Cross - Modal Semantic Alignment</b>.
